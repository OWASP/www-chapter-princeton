## Welcome
Welcome to the OWASP Princeton, New Jersey chapter home page!
The New Jersey Chapter aims to bring together people from research, academia and industry to motivate, and empower others to pursue a career in cybersecurity. We are committed to offer mentorship programs to those new to cybersecurity, provide networking opportunity to like-minded people, and to build a community where everyone can openly discuss current issues/opportunities in cybersecurity.
